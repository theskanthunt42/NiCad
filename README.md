# NiCad - GPX Parser for Python and MicroPython

Parsing GPX files (location log / gps logger data) for my own handy use, in (Micro)Python!

Part of the NCRL Handy-Dandy Hobby project.
Currently in Proof of Concept stage.

Is a library for use with other program, especially aiming it towards MicroPython devices that are restraint in terms of Memory and Working Power.

For me I am targeting RP2040 with 264KB SRAM.

For now of course it's only a PoC and will probably run only on desktop fully fledge Python 3.14 or later.

I write this during my boring ass quote enquote *"Business English"* class in China for fun to not the waste the precious and expensive Conce*ta which mainly to keep me awake and work my shit out of important stuff (Legally obtained from hospital since I just recently got diagnose of some disorders starting with letter "A" ending with D, mutiple of them btw) so don't kill me.

DISCLAIM: DON'T HATE, I AM NOT EVEN A CS STUDENT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT, THANKS. IT'S JUST FOR FUN, DON'T DESTORY THE FUN.

Since some of the library used here are license under MIT so I will do that as well. Maybe I won't need to rely on those later (for saving space) but for now let's jut not reinvent the wheel.
